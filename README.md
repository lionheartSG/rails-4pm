# Ramadhan on Wheels
Introducing a web application designed to modernize and streamline the Ramadhan on Wheels program. Our innovative approach empowers beneficiaries by providing them with credits, which they can use to select and order the specific goods they need for their households. This personalized approach ensures that beneficiaries receive more of the items that are essential to their unique requirements, moving away from a one-size-fits-all package.

## Features

- Each beneficiary is tied with an unique code to access their information to review and submit their order
- Credit-based system: Beneficiaries are allocated credits to make their own selections
- Fully equipped dashboard for ordering and reports


## Built with

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Bootstrap Email](https://bootstrapemail.com/)
- [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team

- [Render](https://render.com/) for deployment , CI/CD pipelines and PostgreSQL management (currently hosted on Railway)
